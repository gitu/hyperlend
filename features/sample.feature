Feature: Happy Path
    Background:
        Given I have deployed the business network definition ..
        And I have added the following participants of type ch.hslu.blc.NaturalPerson
            | email           | firstName | lastName | balance |
            | alice@email.com | Alice     | A        | 0 |
            | bob@email.com   | Bob       | B        | 0 |
            | charlie@email.com   | Charlie   | C        | 0 |
        And I have added the following assets of type ch.hslu.blc.LendingPool
            | poolId  | owner           |
            | 1          | charlie@email.com |
        And I have issued the participant ch.hslu.blc.NaturalPerson#alice@email.com with the identity alice1
        And I have issued the participant ch.hslu.blc.NaturalPerson#bob@email.com with the identity bob1
    Scenario: Alice can add a new loan
        When I use the identity alice1
        When I have added the following assets of type ch.hslu.blc.Loan
            | loanId | owner | state | amount |
            | 1 | alice@email.com | REQUESTED | 1000 |
        Then I should have the following assets of type ch.hslu.blc.LendingPool
            | poolId  | owner           |
            | 1       | charlie@email.com |
